# Mobile Wallet
Is an react native mobile app, where users connect their wallet (via Wallet Connect) and see all their token balances on all chains. They can also see all their NFTs and historical transactions. In periods of high gas prices, an integrated gas price tracker can be very handy. Users can create contacts and transfer assets to them very easily.
